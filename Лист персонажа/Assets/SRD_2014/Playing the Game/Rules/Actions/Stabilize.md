# Stabilize
You can use your action to administer first aid to an Unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful **DC 10 Wisdom** (Medicine) check  
  
A **stable** creature doesn’t make Death Saving Throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn’t healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.
