## Schools of Magic

In the world of Dungeons & Dragons, every magical spell belongs to a school of magic. The schools of magic are abjuration, conjuration, divination, enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, and transmutation. Most classes don't care what school of magic each spell belongs to, but wizards do. Each school of magic has a school of wizards devoted to learning its ways.

### Abjuration = Protectin' stuff
Abjuration is the magic of making magical barriers, shields, binding rituals, or mitigating damage.

The most common use of abjuration is present in support spells, such as those cast by bards, clerics, and paladins. They increase a character's AC, impose disadvantage on enemies, add temporary health pools, interrupt spellcasting, or add resistance to certain magicks.

### Conjuration = Makin' stuff
Conjuration is the magic of making things appear out of nowhere, such as summoning spectral animals or arrows or teleporting.

Conjuration is a little more subjective to the element being used, but for the most part conjuration deals with illusion magic. Most spells in D&D which are considered "conjuration" make something purely out of nothing. For example, *produce flame* is conjuration, whereas *control flame* is transmutation. And normally the effects of conjuration spells are temporary.

Some healing spells are considered conjuration, specifically if the healing is sourced from nature or radiance. Also, teleportation is considered conjuration.

### Divination = Knowin' stuff	
Divination is the magic of being able to magically know more than you'd be capable of otherwise.

Not many spells are under the school of divination. Most of them have to deal with tracking things, such as *hunter's mark* and *find traps*. The wizard School of Divination is a unique one, changing their and their companions' fates daily.

### Enchantment = Convincin' stuff
Enchantment is the magic of making things something they're normally not supposed to do.

Mostly psychic magic deals with enchantment, like casting the *charm* spell. When "enchanting" a weapon to do extra damage, such as the *bless* spell, it's considered enchantment. Many wizards deal with enchantment, especially those who specialize in combat magicks.

### Evocation = Explodin' stuff
Evocation is the magic of creating and manipulating elemental magic. 

Evocation is possibly the most commonly used school of magic, especially amongst those who prefer to deal damage as their contribution.

Almost all spells which you throw something at someone else is considered evocation. Traditionally, evocation deals with the elements (earth, air, fire, water) while conjuration deals with the natural (plants and animals).

### Illusion = Trickin' stuff
Illusion is the magic of making things appear not as they are.

While enchantment magic actually changes something to be not quite what it's supposed to be temporarily, illusion just makes it look like it's something else. Spells like *disguise self* or *invisibility* are illusion magic, making the caster look like something they're not.

### Necromancy = Messin' with Life
Necromancy is the most misunderstood school of magic: it deals with everything messing around with life or death.

Evocation or conjuration spells basically attack someone's HP, while necromancy spells either bolster their target or suck life from their target. Healing or preventing death are also considered necromancy.

For the most part, necromancy as it's used in D&D isn't always evil. It's just a way of referring to spells that mess with life energies, such as reversing death or rapidly decaying living material.

### Transmutation = Changin' stuff
Transmutation is about physically altering something to be something else.

Where enchantment makes things do stuff it's not supposed to do and illusion makes things appear to be something else, transmutation actually changes the thing. The old alchemist myth in the real world of changing stuff into gold is transmutation.
