title: The Bonded
## Background - [The Bonded](2.2%20Epic%20Backgrounds.md#The%20Bonded)
- If you are within 10 feet of your Ally, you gain a +1 bonus to all skill checks and saving throws.

### Heroic Tasks  
The Bonded epic background requires more work for the GM to set up because of all the various pair combinations. However, the following provides a framework to build your own story upon.
#### A Hero’s Voyage
- [ ] Obtain a longship and crew.  
	- **Reward:** If Rivals, the bonded that becomes the ship’s captain gains +1 glory. Additionally, if Allies or Rivals, each selects a feat for which they meet the prerequisites.
#### Proof of Betrayal
- [ ] Gather evidence that proves your jarl cheated your family and others.
#### Wisdom of Peers 
- [ ] Assemble a council of jarls to review your accusations and pass judgment against your jarl.
#### Trial by Combat
- [ ] With your evidence secured, you may issue a challenge against the other jarl. There may be other ways to secure becoming the jarl as well.
	- Each bonded selects one item from the following list (they cannot select the same item):  
		- dwarven plate  
		- Oathbow
		- Staff of Striking
		- Sword of Sharpness
#### Becoming Jarl
- [ ] Once either you or your Rival or Ally is the jarl, your heroic tasks are complete.
#### Epic Goal: Atonement 
- [ ] An innocent has been wronged, and you must find a way to rectify the injustice. Until you do, your clan never completely follows you. And, if rectified, you stand poised to obtain even greater power over all raiding clans.
#### The Jarl’s Right
- [ ] As long as your clan still follows you faithfully, once every two weeks you assemble another explorer class longship complete with crew at your clan’s home port. This crew will die for you without question.
